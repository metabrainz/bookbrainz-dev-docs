Entities
########

In BookBrainz, an entity is a container for some data, associated with some
globally unique identifiers (GIDs). BookBrainz represents a number of different
objects as entities, and each of these has its own particular associated data.
In the following section, we'll go through the database structures used to
represent entities, and talk about each type of entity in more detail.

Generic Entity Tables
=====================

Entity and Entity Redirect
--------------------------
All entity GIDs are stored in a single table in the database, **entity**.

A second table, **entity_redirect**, allows redirection of GIDs. For example, if
one entity was merged into a second entity, then a row would be created in the
**entity_redirect** table to indicate a mapping to the merge target.

Entities in BookBrainz are versioned, which means that the entire entity history
is stored in the database. To make this possible, we have an additional table
in the database, called **entity_tree**.

Entity Tree
-----------
The **entity_tree** table is the place where information is actually stored. You
can think of this table like a folder on a computer. It points to the various
bits of data related to a particular version of the entity. For example, the
most recent annotation ID, disambiguation comment ID and entity-specific data ID
will usually be stored at this level.

When a new version of an entity is created, a corresponding row in
**entity_tree** is created, which will indicate that data was updated by
modifying one of the stored IDs.

Entity Data
-----------

Each entity tree will point to a particular row in the **entity_data** table. We
use joined table inheritance to represent the different entities in BookBrainz,
and this single **entity_data** table represent the base object in this inheritance
hierarchy. It contains an ID and a field to determine the type of entity data
stored, known as the *discriminator*.

Additional Tables
-----------------
There are some additional tables related to all types of entity. We've already
mentioned annotations and disambiguations, so let's talk a little more about
those.

An **annotation** is a way of making notes about an entity, for other
editors to read. It stores some content associated with an ID. Disambiguation
comments, stored in the **disambiguation** table, have a similar data structure
but are intended to contain a short description to allow editors to easily
differentiate between similarly-named entities.

An **alias** represents a name or title. Each alias will store some text along
with a language, and a couple of flags to indicate whether the alias is
*primary* and whether it is *native*. An entity can only have one *native*
alias, which indicates its original name. It can have many *primary* aliases,
which give the most common names in particular languages. *Native* aliases will
usually also be *primary*.

Specific Entities
=================
Publication
-----------
Publications represent the books, magazines, articles, newspapers, novels and
other published materials catalogued in BookBrainz. The table
**publication_data** stores the entity specific data for publications, and
represents an object derived from **entity_data**.
