BookBrainz Schema
#################

Introduction
============
The BookBrainz schema describes how the data used by BookBrainz is stored. It's
quite important to have a good idea of this before you look at any of our code.
If you're coming from a MusicBrainz background, our schema is similar, but there
are some key differences - see :doc:`musicbrainz`.

Definition
==========
The BookBrainz schema is defined in the python-bbschema package, which you can
access at https://github.com/BookBrainz/python-bbschema. When the schema is more
stable, there'll be a nice schema diagram here to help you understand how things
fit together, but for now, you'll have to make do with some words.
